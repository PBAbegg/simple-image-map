    <p>I initially got a degree in audio engineering and have loved every minute of it. The tool provided in the image
        is a mixer that will be used to control a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation).
        Pro Tools is the industry standard and an excellent place to start. It is relatively easy to learn, but hard to
        master.
        Ableton is usually used for live performances.
        logic-pro is best used for creating music in MIDI.
    </p>
    <p>Faders are used to balance what is being recorded and to record you would need some hardware. Focusrite provides
        a wide array of interfaces, ways to connect microphones and instruments to the DAW.
        Shure provides some basic microphones, including the SM58, an the most commonly used microphone, one that is so
        robust that is can be dropped from a helicopter and still work.
        Sweetwater is one of the best providers of instruments, microphones, cables, and anything else used in the
        recording industry.
    </p>
    <p>Now that there is a means to record, you may want to manipulate the sound. This is usually implemented through
        plugins.
        Waves has a huge library of plugins, you can manipulate the recording to sound like a robot is singing from
        underwater, or simply remove a buzz in the background.
        iZotope is on par with Waves, however where Waves provides more versatility, iZotope is more CPU intensive
        making it better for mastering the final product.
        Native-Instruments, like Pro Tools, is an excellent place to start when it comes to learning how to manipulate
        sound.
